      <p>I am an experienced and innovative Software Engineer with a passion for problem-solving and creating efficient solutions. My passion for technology began when I was young, playing on my father's business computers after-hours. After a brief stint in college, I jumped into the workforce.</p>
      <p>During my decade as a Technical Support Engineer I honed my communication skills, learned a wide range of technologies, and discovered I had a talent for creating script-based solutions so I turned my focus to Software Engineering.</p>
      <p>I've since worked in companies both big and small, and experienced a lot. I am ready to pivot when necessary, and able to quickly pick-up whatever knowledge is necessary for the task-at-hand. My expertise in solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions makes me a valuable asset to any technical team.</p>
